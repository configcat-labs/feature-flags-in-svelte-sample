A sample application showcasing how to implement ConfigCat's Feature Flags in a Svelte Application


About Sample App
A demo Svelte application with a simple feature that fetches that displays a random fact about cats each time a user visits or reloads the page. However, the feature is wrapped with a feature flag, so users can only see it when the feature flag is toggled on. Otherwise, a display message is rendered informing users of its unavailability when toggled off.
